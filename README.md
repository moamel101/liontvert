7. Development Plan
I started the summer sessions very late, and I had a big load of classes I had to cover. I could only allocate 4 days per class since I had 7 classes to cover in less than a month. So the timeline is 4 days two days learning about the class and learning how to code using CSS JavaScript and html. And two days for the actual coding 
8. Challenges Anticipated:
I do not have enough time to do something elaborate. So, I opted for a simple and clear website.
The challenges I will be facing are learning to code on time and doing the website on time.
